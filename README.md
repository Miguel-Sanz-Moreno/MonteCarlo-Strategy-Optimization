# MonteCarlo Strategy Optimization
A kind of silly university project that uses an stochastic game, like the famous Bingo, in order to optimize the odds of winning in a non-deterministic environment.

No conclusions were added to the upload as it was an oral defense, but a quick summary would be: speed and initiative matters the most and, when finding one's self short of them, the gap can be filled by keeping up with the stakes of your more proactive competitors. It can seem as a reckless conclusion, but this project focused on the strategy when there's no strategy.
